In this project, we are cloning AirBnB website with its basic functions and usage. We use python as the main programming language
for developing. In terms of storage system in this project, we use two formats: JSON file and MySQL DBMS, firstly, we use JSON and
later on we will use MySQL for store website data efficiently. Our main purpose is to be able to build the core of AirBnB from
scratch making use of OOP princples using python.
